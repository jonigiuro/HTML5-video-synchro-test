Basic instructions: Roll over the video

I used absolute positioning on four different ids containing a different video each, I then added javascript to control the height and/or the width of each. To see the different layers feel free to use these keys to toggle visibility:

Winter:Left

Winter2:Down

Fall:Right

Spring:Up
Also, click to reset the videos. Please note: The rainy video is out of sync because I used a different software for file conversion, I'm going to fix that in the future. The fourth season video will be up soon.

- Please note - I couldn't find a software I like to convert video files, so this experiment only works in Google Chrome and Safari so far.
